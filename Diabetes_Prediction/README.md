# Diabetes_Prediction
1. The task involved data preprocessing to find visual correlations between data variables and consequently design features used to machine learning models towards prediction.
2. Also performed a GridSearchCV analysis for Hyperparameter tuning on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support vector machine and Random Forest models.
3. Random Forest gave the best result towards diabetes prediction with a score of 94%.
